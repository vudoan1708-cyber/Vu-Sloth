# Description
The project is about implementing a GAN (DCGAN, StyleGAN) network to blend facial features of mine and sloth's

# Prerequisites based on Google Colab
Python version: 3.7.10
Tensforflow versions depend on which network is used
## DCGAN
Tensorflow version: 2.4.1
## StyleGAN2
Tensorflow version: 1.15.2

# Caution
Since the files (dataset + training model checkpoints and the result images) are too big. The download time may take a long while. Please be patient! Thank you!!! <br />
Also, the training models were too large even for Github Large File Storage (LFS) to handle (I went out of free quota using LFS so I will upload the full training files in the future). Therefore, some files would be omitted for the sake of uploading and downloading them
