# Description
The project is about implementing a GAN (DCGAN, StyleGAN) network to blend facial features of mine and sloth's

# Prerequisites based on Google Colab
Python version: 3.7.10 <br />
Tensforflow versions depend on which network is used
## DCGAN
Tensorflow version: 2.4.1
## StyleGAN2
Tensorflow version: 1.15.2

# Caution
Since the files (dataset + training model checkpoints and the result images) are too big. The download time may take a long while. Please be patient! Thank you!!! <br />
Also, the training models were too large even for Github Large File Storage (LFS) to handle. Therefore, some other training and image files would be omitted for the sake of uploading and downloading them
